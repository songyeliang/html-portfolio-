<h1>What is Particle Accelerators ?</h1>

<p>Particle accelerators are devices that speed up the particles that make up all matter in the universe and collide them together or into a target. This allows scientists to study those particles and the forces that shape them. 
pecifically, particle accelerators speed up charged particles.
 These are particles with a positive or negative electrical charge such as protons, atomic nuclei, and the electrons that orbit atomic nuclei. 
In some cases, these particles reach speeds close to the speed of light.
 When the particles then collide with targets or other particles, the collisions that result can release energy, produce nuclear reactions, scatter particles, and produce other particles, such as neutrons. This gives scientists a look at what holds atoms, atomic nuclei, and nucleons together, 
 as well as the world of particles like the Higgs boson. 
These particles and forces are the subject of the Standard Model of Particle Physics. Scientists also get insights into the quantum physics that govern how the world behaves at incredibly small scales. In the quantum realm, the classical Newtonian physics that we live with every day is insufficient to explain particle interactions.

<p> How do these machines accelerate particles? They inject particles into a “beamline.” 
This is a pipe held at very low air pressure in order to keep the environment free of air and dust that might disturb the particles as they travel though the accelerator. The particles injected into an accelerator are referred to as a “beam.”
 A series of electromagnets steers and focuses the beam of particles. In a linear accelerator or LINAC (pronounced line-ack or lin-ack), the particles shoot straight toward a fixed target. 
In a circular accelerator, the particles travel around a ring, constantly gaining speed. Circular accelerators can speed particles up in less overall space than a LINAC, but they tend to be more complex to build and operate.
 However, because the particles travel in a circle, circular accelerators create many more opportunities for particles to collide. Particles collide into each other or a target in a device called a particle detector.
  This device measures the particles’ speed, mass, and charge. This information allows scientists to determine what types of particles result from a collision.
