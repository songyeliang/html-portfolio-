<h1>How does Accelerator works?</h1>
<h2>
    
    Accerelator contains two version:  circular amd Linear</h2>
    <p> Accelerators use electromagnetic fields to accelerate and steer particles. 
        Radiofrequency cavities boost the particle beams, 
        while magnets focus the beams and bend their trajectory.</p>

<h3> circular accelerator</h3>

<p>In a circular accelerator, the particles repeat the same circuit for as long as necessary, getting an energy boost at each turn. 
    In theory, the energy could be increased over and over again.
     However, the more energy the particles have, the more powerful the magnetic fields have to be to keep them in their circular orbit.</p>
<h3>Linear Accelerator</h3>

<p>A linear accelerator, on the contrary, is exclusively formed of accelerating structures 
    since the particles do not need to be deflected, 
    but they only benefit from a single acceleration pass.
     In this case, increasing the energy means increasing the length of the accelerator.</p>
<h3>Experience in Accelerator</h3>
<p>As physicists have been explored higher and higher energies, accelerators have become larger and larger: the size of an accelerator is a compromise between energy, the radius of curvature (if itâ€™s circular), the feasibility and the cost.

    Colliders are accelerators that generate head-on collisions between particles. Thanks to this technique, the collision energy 
    is higher because the energy of the two particles is added together.
    
    The Large Hadron Collider is the largest and most powerful collider in the world. It boosts the particles in a loop 27 kilometres in circumference at an energy of 6.5 TeV (teraelectronvolts),
     generating collisions at an energy of 13 TeV.</p>
